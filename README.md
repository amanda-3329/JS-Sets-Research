## Sets


*A set is similar to an array. An array will list out all items, no matter the quantities of each item. But a set can only have one item listed one time- there can be no repetitions. If an existing item is already in the set, you can’t add it. 

This can be useful for unique items, such as unique usernames, customer names, or a unique list of tags on blog posts.
